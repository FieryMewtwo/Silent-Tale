# Compiling

Glossary:
"compile": assemble the "source code" into a playable game.
"source code": the files and documentation in this repository.

These instructions show you how to "compile" Silent Tale from the "source code"

As Silent Tale is in a very early (pre-pre-alpha) stage of development, there are no compilation instructions. (there's no playable game code in the repo!)
